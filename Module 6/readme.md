In this module, we will present the final report that provides insights and deep analysis for the stakeholders. The final report is the culmination of our data collection, data wrangling, data analysis, and data visualization processes. It will showcase our findings, recommendations, and conclusions based on the data. The final report will also include a summary, an introduction, a methodology, a results section, a discussion section, and a references section. The final report will aim to answer the research question or business problem that motivated our project. The final report will be written in a clear, concise, and professional manner, using appropriate language, tone, and format. The final report will be delivered to the stakeholders in a suitable medium, such as a document, a presentation, or a dashboard.
