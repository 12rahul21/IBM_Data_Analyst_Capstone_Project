Data Wrangling or Munging is a process in which we clean up the data set and make it ready for data analysis. Data wrangling is an important step in any data analysis project, as it ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and suitable for further analysis. In this assignment, you will perform the following tasks:

-> Detect duplicate rows in the pandas data frame. Duplicate rows are rows that have identical values for all columns. They can cause errors or bias in the analysis if not removed.

-> Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe using the drop_duplicates() method. This method returns a new dataframe without any duplicate rows.

-> Find the number of missing values for each column using the isnull() and sum() methods. Missing values are values that are not recorded or available in the data. They can affect the quality and reliability of the data if not handled properly.

-> Find the value counts for the column “Employment” using the value_counts() method. This method returns a series containing the counts of unique values in a column. It can help to understand the distribution and frequency of different categories in a column.

->Normalize the data using two existing columns using the apply() functions. Normalizing data is a process of scaling or transforming the data to a common range or standard deviation. It can help to compare or combine different variables or units in a data set.
