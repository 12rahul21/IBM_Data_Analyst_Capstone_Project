# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project



## Introduction:
Thank you for visiting my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project! In this project, I would be impersonating as a data analyst for a global IT and business consulting services firm that specializes in IT solutions and has a team of highly experienced IT consultants. My main objective was to analyze data to determine the future skill requirements for the organization, so that it can remain competitive in the ever-changing technological landscape.
## Objective:
As a Data Analyst, my primary objective was to collect data from various sources such as job postings, training portals, and surveys. The goal was to identify the top programming skills in demand, the most sought-after database skills, and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). I used different methods and tools to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize the data. I also applied statistical techniques to gain insights and make recommendations for the organization.
## Project Tasks:
Data Collection: I will begin by extracting data from various websites and APIs to collect information from different sources, such as job postings, training portals, and surveys. The collected data will be saved in various formats such as .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.

Data Wrangling: After I have acquired the necessary data, I will use data wrangling techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Data Analysis: Using statistical techniques, I will examine the data to find trends, insights, and patterns related to the most in-demand programming languages, top database skills, and popular IDEs.

Presentation: Finally, I will use my storytelling skills to present my findings through a well-organized presentation, highlighting the emerging skill trends for this year.

Iâ€™m eager to dive into this project and provide valuable insights to help the organization stay ahead in the competitive IT landscape. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore the repository for code, data, and the final presentation. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
